Report - Recommendation System

Introduction
The Recommendation System notebook aims to provide personalized item recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions using machine learning models.

Methodology
The following steps were executed:
Data Collection - Gathered user-item interaction data.
Preprocessing - Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis - Identified user behavior patterns and item popularity.
Modeling - Applied collaborative filtering techniques to generate recommendations.
Evaluation - Assessed model performance using precision, recall, and RMSE.

Findings
Successfully generated personalized recommendations for users.
Identified trends in user-item interactions.
Achieved high accuracy in predicting user preferences.

Challenges
Sparse data leading to cold start problems.
Computational complexity with large datasets.

Conclusion
The recommendation system provides meaningful insights into user preferences and helps improve personalized experiences.

Future Work
